fs module - 


SF -------> Read Buffer -----> readfile --> writefile ------> write buffer ------> DF write 


SF ---> read buffer---> readfile
        (chunk) 
streaming - 

chunk ---> storing in the memory --> use it ---> freeing memory
data processing more efficient 

Types -
1. readable stream  -  from where we read data chunk by chunk 
2. writeable stream  -  to which we can write data chunk by chunk 
3. duplex stream - readable and writeable at the same time 
                    ex-  web socket 
4. transform stream - modify or transform data as it is read or written 
                    ex-  zlib (compression and decompression)
